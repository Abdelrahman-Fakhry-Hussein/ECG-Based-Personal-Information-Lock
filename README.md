# ECG-based-Personal-info-Lock.
ECG based Personal info Lock project based on Human Computer  Interfaces (HCI) subject

## An authentication interface based on ECG is needed with the following requirements:
    1) An identification interface for four subjects is needed. Data can be taken from the freely
    published PTB database (healthy subjects) or any another database for ECG.
    2) Use suitable ECG preprocessing.
    3) Use fiducial features.
    4) Choose two classifiers and test different parameters for each of them to get the best
    results for each class.
    5) A subject is considered identified if more than half (or another defined threshold) of his
    ECG heartbeats\segments are classified to any of the four considered subject, otherwise,
    the subject is unidentified.
    6) Compare the classifiers according to the achieved accuracy.
    7) The design of the UI is up to you, for each subject, his personal info will be presented when
    the classifier announces his presence.
